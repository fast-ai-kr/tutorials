    "There is a couple of reasons. First, `fastai` is a wonderful library. It clearly shows how it works in a high-level view. However, when you want to customize its behaviour, the official document is somewhat limited to understand behind scene. Second, `fastai` comes along with other awesome libraries such as `fastcore`. You will find very useful and clever programming usage with them. Also it helps you to have strong programability."
