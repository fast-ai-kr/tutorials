My name is Chansung Park, and I am currently organizing [`fastai` korean group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/fastaikr) based on Facebook. This website is built to support people studying `fastai` by providing examples and internal illutsration of `fastai`, `fastcore`, and more library. 

At this time, I am the only contributor for this website, but possibly there will be many more people from our community!

This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1].

[^1]:a blogging platform that natively supports Jupyter notebooks in addition to other formats.
